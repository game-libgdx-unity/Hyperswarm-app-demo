/**
 * An object with methods that are called during the traversal of the coverage tree.
 * A visitor has the following methods that are called during tree traversal.
 *
 *   * `onStart(root, state)` - called before traversal begins
 *   * `onSummary(node, state)` - called for every summary node
 *   * `onDetail(node, state)` - called for every detail node
 *   * `onSummaryEnd(node, state)` - called after all children have been visited for
 *      a summary node.
 *   * `onEnd(root, state)` - called after traversal ends
 *
 * @param delegate - a partial visitor that only implements the methods of interest
 *  The visitor object supplies the missing methods as noops. For example, reports
 *  that only need the final coverage summary need implement `onStart` and nothing
 *  else. Reports that use only detailed coverage information need implement `onDetail`
 *  and nothing else.
